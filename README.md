# improved_space
A new way for ensemble construction

% usage run test_improved_space

% compare original and improved space versions of ensembles over some datasets
% used ensemble types are Random Forest and Bagging
% used base learners are decision trees
% any type of ensemble and base learner algorithms can be used with improved space by appropriate code changes
% main function: generate_imp_space

% This code includes the demonstration of the following paper. If you use this toolbox, please cite the following paper:
